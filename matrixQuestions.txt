Matrix Multiplication
Find the product of these two matrices
To get you started the top left element is: [7 5]which is the dot product of the first row in the first matrix, and the first column in the second matrix.
The element in the result matrix is equal to the dot product of that element's row in the first matrix and the element's column in the second matrix. 
[[7, 5], [3, 9]]
[[9, 3], [2, 7]]
[[73, 56], [45, 72]]
